2. Prepare the Input File
	Create a text file named ip_addresses.txt in the same directory as the script.
	Add the list of IP addresses you want to resolve to DNS in the ip_addresses.txt file. Make sure each IP address is on a separate line.

3. Open the Terminal or Command Prompt
	Open the terminal or command prompt on your operating system.

4. Navigate to the Script Directory
	Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where the script nslookupscript.py is located.

5. Run the Script
	Execute the script by entering the following command in the terminal or command prompt: "python nslookupscript.py"

6. View the Output
	Once the script has finished running, you can find the resolved DNS names in the nslookups.txt file in the same directory as the script.

Make sure to follow these instructions step by step, and if you encounter any issues, double-check the file paths and names in the script. If the script is unable to find the input file, ensure that the file exists and is located in the same directory as the script.
